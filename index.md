Welcome to Shusuke Okita's Website!
I am a PhD student at University of California Irvine.

I am studying under the supervision by Dr. David J. Reinkensmeyer in UCI BioRobotics Lab.

My research interests lie in areas of robotics, control and automation, and human-robot interaction(HRI).

I'm currently working on the development of home rehabilitative systems using wearable sensor.

## Research Experiences


### Development of Quality Measure toward Movement Smoothness(September 2020 - May 2021)
Research Interests - Stroke, Algorithm, Rehabilitation
Paper Title - Measuring Movement Quality of the Stroke-Impaired Upper
Extremity with a Wearable Sensor: Toward a Smoothness Metric for
Home Rehabilitation Exercise Programs

The paper is going to be published on the EMBC 2021.

### Development of Minimalistic Exoskeleton(April 2017 - March 2018)
Research Interests - Robotics, Soft Robotics, Rehabilitation Robotics

As a Visiting Scholar in the BioRobotics Lab of Professor David Reinkensmeyer, I made an exoskeleton using a soft actuator that auguments the force of the pinch motion.

- I analyzed mechanical properties of the soft actuator creating the test bench
- made an exoskeleton using soft robotics(soft robotics, Control, Electronics)
- analyzed mechanical properties of the soft actuator (MATLAB)

## Project Experiences

### Image Processing for the Space Debris tracking (July 2016)
To track streaks of the space debris, I participated in the development of the image recognition algorithm.

### FSAE Competition(September, 2015)
As a Bachelor's thesis project, I Joined a Student Formula Car Development Competition (FSAE - JAPAN) in September 2015

My team placed 11th among 83 teams

The objective of this project was to develop a student formula car for the competition and get a higher place than last year's (32th)

I contributed to getting a higher place and improving the performance. I was responsible for managing a team as a management leader, and I developed several components mandatory for assembling a car

I developed the following components and played the following role

- made an Upright and Hub using the FEM analysis and CATIA. It was manufactured using CNC
- presented the manufacturing process of the Upright and Hub at the Cost Examination
- designed a braking system
- planned a strategy for the Cost Examination
- managed a team and made a schedule to develop and manufacture the student formula car

## Volunteer Experience
### Student Jazz Festival in Tokyo (May, 2014)
- as an exective staff, participated the biggest Student Jazz Festival in Odaiba, Tokyo (Jazzline 2014)
