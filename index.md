## Research Experiences

## Project Experiences
### FSAE Competition(September, 2015)
As a Bachelor's thesis project, I Joined a Student Formula Car Development Competition (FSAE - JAPAN) in September 2015.
My team placed 11th among 83 teams. The objective of this project was to develop a student formula car for the competition and get a higher place than last year's (32th). I contributed to getting a higher place and improving the performance. I was responsible for managing a team as a management leader, and I developed several components mandatory for assembling a car.
