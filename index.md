## Shusuke Okita

Welcome to Shusuke Okita's Website!
I am a PhD student at University of California Irvine.

I am studying under the supervision by Dr. David J. Reinkensmeyer in UCI BioRobotics Lab.

My research interests lie in areas of robotics, control and automation, and human-robot interaction(HRI).

I'm currently working on the development of home rehabilitative systems using wearable sensor.

## Research Experiences
### Development of Minimalistic Exoskeleton(April 2017 - March 2018)
Research Interests: Robotics, Soft Robotics, Rehabilitation Robotics

As a Visiting Scholar in the BioRobotics Lab of Prof. David Reinkensmeyer, I made an exoskeleton using a soft actuator.\. 
I analyzed mechanical properties of the soft actuator creating the test bench.\. 


## Project Experiences
### FSAE Competition(September, 2015)
As a Bachelor's thesis project, I Joined a Student Formula Car Development Competition (FSAE - JAPAN) in September 2015.\. 

My team placed 11th among 83 teams.\. 

The objective of this project was to develop a student formula car for the competition and get a higher place than last year's (32th).\. 

I contributed to getting a higher place and improving the performance. I was responsible for managing a team as a management leader, and I developed several components mandatory for assembling a car.\. 

I developed the following components and played the following role.\. 

- made an Upright and Hub using the FEM analysis and CATIA. It was manufactured using CNC.
- presented the manufacturing process of the Upright and Hub at the Cost Examination.
- designed a braking system
- planned a strategy for the Cost Examination.
- managed a team and made a schedule to develop and manufacture the student formula car
