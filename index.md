## Shusuke Okita

Welcome to Shusuke Okita's Website!
I am a PhD student at University of California Irvine workin
I am studying under the supervision by Dr. David J. Reinkensmeyer in UCI BioRobotics Lab.
My research interests lie in areas of robotics, control and automation, and human-robot interaction(HRI).
I'm currently working on the development of home rehabilitative systems using wearable sensor.

## Research Experiences

## Project Experiences
### FSAE Competition(September, 2015)
As a Bachelor's thesis project, I Joined a Student Formula Car Development Competition (FSAE - JAPAN) in September 2015.
My team placed 11th among 83 teams. The objective of this project was to develop a student formula car for the competition and get a higher place than last year's (32th). I contributed to getting a higher place and improving the performance. I was responsible for managing a team as a management leader, and I developed several components mandatory for assembling a car. I developed the following components and played the following role.

- made an Upright and Hub using the FEM analysis and CATIA. It was manufactured using CNC.
- presented the manufacturing process of the Upright and Hub at the Cost Examination.
- designed a braking system
- planned a strategy for the Cost Examination.
- managed a team and made a schedule to develop and manufacture the student formula car
